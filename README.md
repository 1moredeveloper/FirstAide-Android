# PCSA

 * Introduction
Peace Corps is committed to providing a compassionate and supportive response to 
all Volunteers who have been sexually assaulted. To that end, the Peace Corps makes 
the following commitment to our Volunteers who are victims of sexual assault.

This project is to support this initiative by creating a mobile app that PCVs can readily have accessible to report or
gain information on Peace Corps Safety and Security procedures.

The mobile application will be developed in both Android and iOS platforms.

 * Requirements
You should have either the Eclipse IDE or Android Studio installed to run the project, since it is an android app. 

 * Recommended modules
If your emulator is slow, it is recommended you install an external one, such as from Genymotion. This way you may run the app quicker.

 * Installation
To install, first clone the object from Github and install as you normally would. Then, open it from Eclipse or Android Studio. If prompted, install the required build tools, and then go ahead and press the play button to run. Make sure to select an emulator. 

 * Troubleshooting
If there are any problems encountered when installing the IDE, you may want to check and make sure you have a JDK and JRE installed. If you experience trouble building or running the project, you may not have the necessary build tools, which you can download directly through the IDE. If the app does not run on the emulator, it may be that the emulator is too slow, and you should look into installing one from an outside source.
